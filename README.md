This is an implementation of 'Make Valid Equation' problem in Java.

In this the numbers are supplied by the user and the application computes the operators such that 
Right Hand Side=Left Hand Side

The numbers are supplied through a file call equation.txt.

For example the equation is  -->   4+1-2=3
Then the numbers have to be supplied through the text file like the following-

4
4
1
2
3

The first number signifies the total number of numbers in the equation.
And then the numbers of the equation follow.


The technique used here is recursive backtracking.

You can make such a notepad file and then give its complete path in the main function.
The application will automatically print the complete equation.

A sample equation.txt is kept in the repository for your reference.
